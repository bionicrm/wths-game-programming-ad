# WTHS Game Programming Ad

An advertisement animation for WTHS Game Programming. Ignore the terrible code ;)

### Setup

To set up development on your local machine, the following is required:

- NPM + NodeJS (`sudo apt-get install npm node nodejs nodejs-legacy`)
- [Dart SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/downloads/)

Once the repository is cloned, run `sudo npm install` to install required dependencies. Then run `grunt watch` to watch for changes to .dart files for "auto-re-trans-compilation".
